# Tic Tac Toe

This Tic Tac Toe game is a simple implementation in Java created in 2020 for educational purposes, showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows two players to play against each other. Each player has three stones of two different types. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to get three of your stones in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Getting Started

To play the game, compile and run the `main.java` file. The game will start with player 1 and prompt for input to place stones on the board.

## Files

- `main.java`: The entry point of the game. It creates two Spieler objects representing the players, and a TicTacToe object representing the game board.
- `Spieler.java`: Represents a player in the game. Contains the player's name, stones, and methods for interacting with the stones.
- `TicTacToe.java`: Represents the game logic and board. Contains methods for placing stones, printing the board, and checking if a player has won.

## How to Play

1. Compile the `main.java` file.
2. Run the compiled `main.class` file.
3. Follow the prompts to input the row, column, and stone number you wish to place on the board.
4. The game will switch between the two players until one of them wins.
